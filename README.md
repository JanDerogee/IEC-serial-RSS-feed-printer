# RSS news feed printer (for Commodore IEC serial printers)
RSS newsfeed printer

This project uses an ESP8266 to get the RSS feed from the internet, it extracts title, description and pubDate from the feed and prints the item to the printer.
The printer must be a Commodore compatible printer, using a Commodre IEC serial interface. I used the Borther HR-5C printer, but the MPS-803 seems (hevent't tried it myself, but the manula seems to suggest it is so) to be compatible (or vice versa).
